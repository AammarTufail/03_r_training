## Skewness and Kurtosis in a Normal Distribution

In a normally distributed sample, the **skewness** and **kurtosis** are expected to have specific values.

### Skewness
Skewness measures the asymmetry of the distribution. For a normal distribution:

- **Skewness** should be approximately **0**.
  
  This indicates that the data is symmetric with no skewness (neither to the left nor to the right).

### Kurtosis
Kurtosis measures the "tailedness" of the distribution. For a normal distribution:

- **Kurtosis** should be approximately **3**.
  
  Sometimes, **excess kurtosis** is used, which is the kurtosis value minus 3. In this case, for a normal distribution, the excess kurtosis is **0**.

### Summary
For a normally distributed sample:

- **Skewness** ≈ 0
- **Kurtosis** ≈ 3 (or excess kurtosis ≈ 0)
  
These values are expected for a perfectly normal distribution, though slight deviations can occur in real-world data.
